Since I bought my house and have a staircase, I say to my wife it is dangerous the night.<br /><br />
We have the bad habit of letting things drag on the stairs to mount these later. Most of the time, we forget to do it.<br /><br />
So it becomes dangerous the night to use the stairs, and it will become more dangerous with my two children when they
will wake up at night.<br /><br />
So, I bought at <a href="www.leroymerlin.fr">Leroy Merlin</a> a ledstrip to have a light at night and weak enough to
not wake up everyone :<br /><br />

There's a little IR receiver in the stairs. In the future, I will do some automation to automatically power on the
light when someone will be detected in the corridor at night. <a href="http://www.lisa-project.net">L.I.S.A</a> will be
able to manage it too.
