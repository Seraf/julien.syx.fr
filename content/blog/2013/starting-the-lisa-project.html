Hello everyone,<br />
I was watching Iron Man 3 and I wonder if someone has already started a JARVIS like project.<br />
Someone has already started this, but around the Microsoft technologies because it was "working out of the box"<br/>
I wanted something which works on Linux that's why I decided to start my own project (and to learn Python too).
I will keep you informed about this project on my blog !
